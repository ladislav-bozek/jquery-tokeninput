jQuery Tokeninput: A Tokenizing Autocomplete Text Entry
=======================================================

NOTE: This fork does not have to be managed in future. It contains only small fixes that improved behaviour on mobile devices. Specially the problem where searching was not working while typing in tokeninput on iphone or ipad. Also there was problem that TAB key didn't move focus to another input in form. We are using this fork in the [CVlite.sk](http://www.cvlite.sk/) project until these issues will be fixed in official version.

Overview
--------
Tokeninput is a jQuery plugin which allows your users to select multiple items from a predefined list, using autocompletion as they type to find each item. You may have seen a similar type of text entry when filling in the recipients field sending messages on facebook.
