jQuery Tokeninput: A Tokenizing Autocomplete Text Entry
=======================================================

NOTE: We do not plan any active development here. This fork contains only small fixes that improved behaviour on mobile devices. The solution is not ideal but it has worked for us. We are using this fork of jquery-tokeninput in the [CVlite.sk](http://www.cvlite.sk/) project until issues will be fixed in official version. Specially the problem where searching was not working while typing in tokeninput on iphone or ipad. Also there was problem that TAB key didn't move focus to another input in form. 

Overview
--------
Tokeninput is a jQuery plugin which allows your users to select multiple items from a predefined list, using autocompletion as they type to find each item. You may have seen a similar type of text entry when filling in the recipients field sending messages on facebook.
